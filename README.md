# Module 08 Challenge - Movies-ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline
to be used for daily database updates.

Once complete, the Pipeline will take in new data, perform the appropriate
transformations, and load the data into existing SQL Tables.

It is refactored from previous code that accomplished a similar task
using separate functions.

Here, the process will be completed from within one single Function.

### General workflow
1. Import three files 1) wikipedia-movies.json 2) movies_metadata.csv 3) ratings.csv
2. Clean and Transform Data
3. Add the data to a PostgreSQL Database. Non-destructively append on successive updates.
